# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where classes seem to be correctly written, yet they are not applied.  The issue is commonly resolved by checking for conflicting CSS or build process problems. This repo provides an example of the problem and its solution.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a simple button example using Tailwind CSS classes. However, these classes do not apply correctly, leaving the button without the expected styling. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides the fix.  The solution often involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correct and that there aren't any CSS conflicts overriding the Tailwind classes.
